<!-- Describe the project in brief -->
In this project, I performed some data analysis on the matches and record of FIFA '19 using Python.

The following python libraries were used in this project:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)

**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are used for data visualization in this project. 
**[Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/)** library was also used to make an interactive scatter plot visualization, but it is optional. For more information regarding **bokeh** read the documentation.(link has been provided)

## Data Visualizations
Here are a few snippets of plots generated from the fifa data:
